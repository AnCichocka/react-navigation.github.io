Testing code using React Navigation may require some setup since we need to mock native dependencies used in the navigators. We recommend using [Jest](https://jestjs.io) to write unit tests.

## Mocking native modules

To be able to test React Navigation components, certain dependencies will need to be mocked depending on which components are being used.

If you're using `@react-navigation/drawer`, you will need to mock:

- `react-native-reanimated`
- `react-native-gesture-handler`

If you're using `@react-navigation/stack`, you will only need to mock:

- `react-native-gesture-handler`

To add the mocks, create a file `jest/setup.js` (or any other file name of your choice) and paste the following code in it:

```js
// Include this line for mocking react-native-gesture-handler
import 'react-native-gesture-handler/jestSetup';

// Include this section for mocking react-native-reanimated
jest.mock('react-native-reanimated', () =>
  require('react-native-reanimated/mock')
);

// Silence the warning: Animated: `useNativeDriver` is not supported because the native animated module is missing
jest.mock('react-native/Libraries/Animated/NativeAnimatedHelper');
```

Then we need to use this setup file in our jest config. You can add it under `setupFiles` option in a `jest.config.js` file or the `jest` key in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "preset": "react-native",
  "setupFiles": ["<rootDir>/jest/setup.js"]
}
```

Make sure that the path to the file in `setupFiles` is correct. Jest will run these files before running your tests, so it's the best place to put your global mocks.

If your configuration works correctly, you can skip this section, but in some unusual cases you will need to mock `react-native-screens` as well. To add mock of the particular component, e.g. `Screen`, add the following code in `jest/setup.js` file:

```js
// Include this section form mocking react-native-screens
jest.mock('react-native-screens', () => {
  // Require actual module instead of a mock
  let screens = jest.requireActual('react-native-screens');

  // All exports in react-native-screens are getters
  // We cannot use spread for cloning as it will call the getters
  // So we need to clone it with Object.create
  screens = Object.create(
    Object.getPrototypeOf(screens),
    Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(screens)
  );

  // Add mock of the Screen component
  Object.defineProperty(screens, 'Screen', {
    value: require('react-native').View,
  });

  return screens;
});
```

If you're not using Jest, then you'll need to mock these modules according to the test framework you are using.

## Writing tests

We recommend using [React Native Testing Library](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/) along with [`jest-native`](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-native) to write your tests.

<Tabs groupId="example" queryString="example">
<TabItem value="static" label="Static" default>

```js

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="dynamic" label="Dynamic">

```js

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Best practices

There are a couple of things to keep in mind when writing tests for components using React Navigation:

1. Avoid mocking React Navigation. Instead, use a real navigator in your tests.
2. Don't check for navigation actions. Instead, check for the result of the navigation such as the screen being rendered.
